## About this repo

This repo is intended to practice the basics of BDD (Behavior Driven Development) in a simple game (`tic-tac-toe`) written in Python

## Testing with BDD

To test the tic-tac-toe game, we created 3 feature files:
- GameResult: to test if the game is tie, won or not yet finished
- PrintBoard: to test the game board printing
- ValidMarkers: to test if the users (Player 1 and Player 2) chose the correct markers ("X" or "O")
